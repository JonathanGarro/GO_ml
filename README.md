## Appeals

Using a dataset comprised of appeal data merged with INFORM data, this ML model analyzes various datapoints and predicts the appeal budget based on the emergency location, appeal type, and number of beneficiaries.

The model needs to be tuned, as this POC functions but returns a negative r-squared value in the current configuration.
